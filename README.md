This dataset consists of __4095 images__ belonging to two classes:
*	__with_mask: 2165 images__
*	__without_mask: 1930 images__

The images used were real images of faces wearing masks. The images were collected from the following sources:

* __Bing Search API__ ([See Python script](https://github.com/ombhatia99/Face-Mask-Detector/blob/main/search.py))
* __Kaggle datasets__ 
* __RMFD dataset__ ([See here](https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset))([medium article link](https://medium.com/the-programming-hub/wolrds-most-complete-masked-face-recognition-dataset-is-for-free-10d780eed512))
